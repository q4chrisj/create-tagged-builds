# Create Tagged Builds - POC

## Scope of this POC:

1. Will not address tagging the repository.
2. Will take a project name string and tag string as input.
3. Will create a new tagged build under provided project name with the name of the tag.
4. Once the tagged build has been created successfully then trigger the build programtically.
5. Use a simple repo (with minimal external dependencies on foundation and go service).
